# EXPLORE Phase Instructions

## Your Task
You have 15-20 minutes to review all documentation in this folder and extract the requirements for a Discount Engine Validator tool. This phase is critical - thorough exploration here will make your planning and execution phases much smoother.

## What You'll Find Here
This folder contains various business communications including:
- Meeting transcripts
- Email exchanges
- Slack conversations
- Whiteboard notes
- Customer feedback
- JIRA tickets

These documents contain a mix of relevant requirements and typical business "noise" - contradictions, tangents, and evolving decisions that reflect real-world scenarios.

## Deliverable
Create a **comprehensive findings document** that serves as a Statement of Work (SOW) from a customer/sales perspective. This document should capture ALL requirements necessary to understand what needs to be built and why.

## Suggested Structure

Your findings document might include sections like:

### 1. Requirements & Rules
- The business problem and solution requirements
- Key business rules and discount behaviors
- Important edge cases and constraints

### 2. Decisions & Assumptions
- How you resolved conflicting requirements
- Key assumptions you're making
- Your reasoning for important decisions

### 3. Open Questions
- Unresolved questions to address in planning
- Identified risks or concerns

Bring your own expertise and structure this however makes sense for communicating your findings. There's no single correct format.

## What We're Looking For
- Can you identify the core requirements from noisy documentation?
- Do you make reasonable decisions when faced with conflicts?
- Are you able to separate important details from noise?

## Tips for Success
- Use your AI tools strategically to process documentation quickly
- Some details contradict each other - document these conflicts and your decisions
- Not everything is relevant - filter out the noise
- Focus on extracting concrete requirements that will inform your implementation
- Think from a customer perspective: What would they need to see in an SOW?
- The more thorough you are here, the easier your plan and execute phases will be

Good luck!
