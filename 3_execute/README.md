# EXECUTE Phase Instructions

## Your Task
You have 10-15 minutes to implement a working Discount Engine Validator based on your exploration findings and technical plan. If you've done the first two phases properly, this should be straightforward implementation work.

## What You'll Work With
- Your findings document from the EXPLORE phase (business requirements)
- Your technical plan from the PLAN phase (implementation blueprint)
- Test data files in this folder:
  - `orders.csv` - Order data to process
  - `coupons.json` - Coupon definitions and rules
- Any language and libraries you choose (though external libraries shouldn't be necessary)

## Deliverable
Create **working code** directly in this `3_execute` directory that:
- Implements the requirements from your exploration
- Follows your technical plan
- Processes the provided test data (orders.csv and coupons.json)
- Generates output files as defined in your plan

## Test Data
You'll find two data files here:
- `orders.csv` - Order data to process
- `coupons.json` - Coupon definitions and rules

Generate whatever output files make sense based on your requirements analysis and technical plan. Focus on demonstrating that your solution works correctly with the provided data.

## What We're Looking For
- Does your code correctly implement the requirements from explore phase?
- Did you follow your technical plan?
- Does your solution handle all the edge cases you identified?
- Is the code clean and working?
- Do the outputs match what was specified in your requirements?

## Tips for Success
- This should be the quickest phase if you planned well
- Focus on clean, working implementation - not over-engineering
- Test your solution with the provided data files
- Ensure your output formats match your specifications
- Remember: This is a standalone script, not a production system
- Don't worry about configuration files or environment variables

Good luck!
