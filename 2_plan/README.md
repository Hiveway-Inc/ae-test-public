# PLAN Phase Instructions

## Your Task
You have 15-20 minutes to create a comprehensive technical implementation plan based on the requirements you extracted in the EXPLORE phase. This is where you transition from business requirements to technical design - answer all remaining questions and create a clear blueprint for implementation.

## What You'll Work With
The requirements document you created in the EXPLORE phase, including:
- Business rules and constraints
- Your decisions on conflicting requirements
- Edge cases and concerns you identified

## Deliverable
Create a **Technical Implementation Plan** that translates your business requirements into a technical approach. The goal is to resolve all ambiguities and create a clear path to implementation.

## Suggested Elements

Your technical plan might address areas such as:

### Key Decisions
- How you've resolved conflicting requirements
- Technical choices and reasoning
- Answers to open questions from exploration

### Technical Approach
- Core architecture and data structures
- Key algorithms and processing logic
- Input/output specifications

### Implementation Strategy
- Main implementation steps
- Validation and error handling approach
- Expected outputs

Remember: Structure this however makes sense for your technical approach. The language you choose, libraries you might use, and specific implementation details are entirely your decisions. We want to see YOUR technical thinking, not a prescribed format.

## What We're Looking For
- Does your plan address all requirements?
- Is the plan clear and logical?
- Would this approach actually work?
- How well did you break down the problem?
- Did you plan for the tricky scenarios?

## Tips for Success
- This is your technical phase - be specific and detailed
- Every ambiguity should be resolved with a clear decision
- Your plan should be so complete that implementation becomes mechanical
- Consider all the technical details: data types, precision, validation, etc.
- Think through the actual code structure you'll implement
- If something was unclear in explore phase, make a decision and document it

Good luck!
